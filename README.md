        <td>
            This was actually a very small project of mine, but I loved building it so much that I just had to include it because of its uniqueness. The backend was built using the <b>Rocket framework</b> for rust, which alongside Actix is one of the biggest rust web frameworks out there, it was only on version 0.5rc1 when I built this project so it was quite a challenge figuring out some stuff. The frontend was also special, I used web assembly with rust framework <b>Yew</b>, meaning the project frontend which is a SPA has pretty much no javascript, only web assembly. Yew was at the time on version 0.18 with quite limited documentation, making it quite hard but fun to build this project.
